## FrontEnd-capstone - CONNECT
### A Social Media Application for simple real-time communication between users, building relationships, and sharing photos.

"Connect" is a social-media application written using the Angular Framework, Javascript & Google's Firebase for the back-end database.

Users sign-in using their Google account and the system builds their profile based on the Account's credentials. Once signed-up, users have the ability to modify their profile, add a profile image, upload photos to a gallery and 'connect' with other users.

Once a user is connected with another, they can share updates/photos, write real time messages to each other, and add a relationship/partner.
